# My Simple Weather

Weather sites & apps are needlessly complex and filled with ads. I want to know what the general temps & precipitation will be today and later this week.

This app uses vite, React, & RTK Query

TODO:

- port over the D3.js visualizations
- support cross platform w/ Capacitor.

This repo is a port of a similar app previously developed at https://github.com/acamann/SimpleWeather to originally explore React Native, and Android/iOS development using Expo.
